                    <H4>For the first time since 2000, the Harvest Moon will rise on Friday the 13th this year –– at least for some of us.It’s what is called a “split” full moon</H4>

                    <p>“During the harvest season farmers sometimes need to work late into the night by the light of the moon,” according to NASA. “Usually the full moon rises an average of 50 minutes later each night, but for the few nights around the Harvest Moon, the moon seems to rise at nearly the same time: just 25 to 30 minutes later across the northern U.S., and only 10 to 20 minutes later for much of Canada and Europe.”
                        The particulars of a Harvest Moon vary by date but not by circumstance, as NASA shows in this video from 2013.

        <p>El gobierno estadounidense puso en marcha un sistema caótico que obliga a los migrantes vulnerables a esperar semanas en la ciudad de Tijuana para ejercer su derecho constitucional de solicitar asilo en Estados Unidos. Dicho proceso sin duda reafirma la política migratoria extrema de Washington. Un reportaje especial cuenta algunas de sus historias.

        <blockquote> "What is a Harvest Moon? On average, the moon rises about 50 minutes later each day. But when a full moon happens close to an autumn equinox, the moon rises closer to the time of sunset. For mid-temperate latitudes, it rises only about 25 to 30 minutes later daily for several days before and after the full Harvest moon.
            For very high northern latitudes, there’s even less time between successive moonrises. The difference between 50 minutes and 30 minutes might not seem like much. But it means that, in the nights after a full Harvest Moon, you’ll see the moon ascending in the east relatively soon after sunset. The moon will rise during or near twilight on these nights, making it seem as if there are several full moons – for a few nights in a row – around the time of the Harvest Moon."
