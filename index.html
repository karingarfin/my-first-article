                <H4>For the first time since 2000, the Harvest Moon will rise on Friday the 13th this year –– at least for some of us.
It’s what is called a “split” full moon</H4>

                <p>“During the harvest season farmers sometimes need to work late into the night by the light of the moon,” according to NASA. “Usually the full moon rises an average of 50 minutes later each night, but for the few nights around the Harvest Moon, the moon seems to rise at nearly the same time: just 25 to 30 minutes later across the northern U.S., and only 10 to 20 minutes later for much of Canada and Europe.”
The particulars of a Harvest Moon vary by date but not by circumstance, as NASA shows in this video from 2013.</p>
